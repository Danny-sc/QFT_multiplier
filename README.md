# QFT_multiplier

This repository contains a Qiskit implementation of the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) Multiplier proposed by Ruiz-Perez and Garcia-Escartin in [Quantum Arithmetic with the Quantum Fourier Transform](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.5949.pdf).

More precisely, you will find:

- A Jupyter Notebook with a demonstration of the implemented algorithm and an exploration of its properties;
- A Python file with code to perform the QFT;
- A Python file with code to perform the QFT  Multiplier;
- A Python file with code to analyze the number of operations and depth used by the QFT Multiplier as a function of the size of the numbers multiplied;
- A Python file with code to analyze the performance of the QFT Multiplier when noise is added, in the form of a depolarizing error channel;
- A folder with all plots and diagrams needed in the Jupyter Notebook.
